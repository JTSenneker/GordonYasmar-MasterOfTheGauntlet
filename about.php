            <h2>Joe Senneker</h2>
            <p class="quote">"You know, that's a really good idea."</p>
            <p>Joe is currently a student at Ferris State University in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He is going through Ferris's Digital Animation and Game Design Program. He is currently employed by a Video Rental store, the name of which escapes me. While at work (and not working, because lets be honest who rents videos anymroe) Joe likes to come up with insane video game ideas, such as <em>Gordon Yasmar: Savior of the Sunken Civilization</em>, <em>Gordon Yasmar: Master of the Gauntlet</em>, and <em>Chocolate Thunder and Vanilla Wonder: Bro's in Time</em>. In his free time Joe likes wander the countryside in hopes of one day finding the fox that stole his bagel oh so many years ago...

            <h2>Eric Selover</h2>
            <p class="quote">"Can't talk. Need to finish Capstone."</p>
            <p>Eric is finishing up his degree at Ferris State University. He spends most of his time working on documents for his Capstone and working at some sort of Shipping Company. When not typing up documents or running around in a warehouse shouting into a microphone, Eric can be found with his cat Lila. In sharp contrast to her owner Eric, Lila is full of energy and has spent countless hours roaming the dark alleys of Grand Rapids. Unbeknownst to Eric, Lila is actually a crime lord (main offences include smuggling catnip) who is in hiding after a close call with Swiss Police Dogs.

            <h2>Jonathan Champion</h2>
            <p class="quote">"I'm a Champion."</p>
            <p>John is currenty a Junior at Ferris State University. Besides working on his schoolwork, John interns at YETi CGI, a small gaming studio. In his free time John likes to switch between helping freshmen with their programming homework to dishing out sarcasm and insults to anyone who comes near. Before entering college John spent many a day outside wandering in the forests of Michigan, however now those days are limited to a handful a year when he goes camping with his friends. John's personal life is largely a mystery to those in DAGD; he goes to great lengths to keep it that way.

            <p>Jacob is working towards getting his Bachelor of Applied Science degree from Ferris State University. When not working on his copious amounts of homework and projects he likes to spend his time on Facebook while watching his favorite sports teams fail miserably.
